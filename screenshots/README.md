# Screenshots

Full-page captures of the main app screens, kept for reference (design
reviews, docs, before/after comparisons). Two viewports:

- `mobile/` — 390×844 (iPhone-ish)
- `desktop/` — 1440×900

Both against the live production site (`run.camboulive.solutions`), logged in
as a real account, dark theme.

## What's captured

Per viewport: Home, Plan (+ a week expanded, + the "Edit plan" form showing
its 3 numbered sections), Coach chat (+ conversation history, + the daily
usage popover), Record a run (+ the live GPS tracker), Races (My Races, Find
a race, a race's detail expanded), Progress (Log, Stats, Badges), Settings.
See `capture.js` for the exact click path if you want to extend it.

## How to (re-)run this

These are Playwright scripts, run standalone — they're not part of the app's
own test suite or `package.json`.

1. Install Playwright once (from this `screenshots/` folder or anywhere):
   ```
   npm install playwright
   npx playwright install chromium
   ```
2. Log in once. This opens a real, visible Chromium window against
   `run.camboulive.solutions` — log in there by hand (this script never
   touches or stores your password, only the resulting session):
   ```
   node login.js
   ```
   It waits for the dashboard to appear, then saves the logged-in session to
   `auth.json` next to this README. **`auth.json` is gitignored — it's live
   session state, never commit it.**
3. Capture:
   ```
   node capture.js          # both viewports
   node capture.js mobile   # just one
   node capture.js desktop
   ```
   Screenshots land in `mobile/` and `desktop/`, overwriting any existing
   files with the same name.

## Notes / known quirks

- Full-page screenshots are real (`page.screenshot({ fullPage: true })`), not
  a stitched approximation — scrolled-past content is genuinely captured.
- Tailwind's `fixed` utility (nav bar, modal overlays) fights full-page
  capture: a truly `fixed` element gets pinned to the viewport and repeats at
  every scroll offset when Playwright stitches the page. `capture.js` works
  around this by temporarily neutralizing `.fixed` positioning (and, when a
  modal is open, hiding the rest of the page so it can't bleed through below
  the modal's real content) just for the screenshot, then restoring it.
  Neutralizing `position` alone isn't enough: an absolutely-positioned block
  with `width:auto` and both `left`/`right` auto shrinks to fit its content
  (CSS 10.3.7) instead of spanning the viewport the way `fixed inset-x-0` /
  `inset-0` do — so the override also forces `width: 100% !important`. Without
  it, the bottom nav rendered squished on every shot but the first
  (`01-home.png`); the header had the identical bug but it was invisible
  there because its `bg-slate-900` matches the page background.
- At the 1440×900 desktop viewport the app itself doesn't have a distinct
  desktop layout — content stays mobile-width, nav full-width at the bottom.
  That one's real, not a capture artifact — worth knowing before reading the
  desktop screenshots as "the desktop design."
- Selectors in `capture.js` are hand-picked against the current UI (e.g.
  `button[aria-label="Record a run"]`, `button[aria-label="Settings"]`,
  `button[aria-label="Close"]`, `button:text-is("Coach")`). If the app markup
  changes, some steps may silently no-op (most are wrapped in `isVisible()`
  checks) rather than throw — spot-check the output.
