# Coach agent — architecture & operations

A propose-and-confirm AI agent that **adapts** the existing training plan
through a bounded set of typed tools. The deterministic generator
(`src/utils/plan.ts` `buildPlan`) stays the author of plan structure; the model
is an **editor, never an author**.

```

## Invariants (do not break)

1. **Trust boundary** — the API key, the validator, the tool implementations,
   the rate limit, and the audit log live in the edge function. The client
   sends a message and renders the proposal.
2. **Editor, never author** — the model acts only through the bounded tools in
   `supabase/functions/_shared/coach/tools.mjs`. No free-text plan generation.
   The one load-increasing tool, `add_session`, is bounded three ways: the
   tool itself refuses dates inside the final 14 days and caps distance at
   the plan's longest existing training session; the validator's ramp rule
   gates the resulting week; and the system prompt licenses it only for
   explicit extra availability — never to make up missed volume, never
   during pain/illness. `cancel_session` marks a session `skipped` (the
   app's existing flag) rather than deleting it; skipped sessions carry no
   training load in the validator (volume/spacing/taper rules ignore them).
3. **One validator, two callers** — `validatePlan`
   (`supabase/functions/_shared/coach/validation.mjs`) is shared by the agent
   path and confirmed against `buildPlan` output by
   `src/utils/coachValidation.test.ts`. The app re-exports it as
   `src/utils/coachValidation.ts`.
4. **An invalid plan is never surfaced** — `generateProposal`
   (`_shared/coach/engine.mjs`) runs an internal validate-and-retry loop
   (bounded by `MAX_VALIDATOR_RETRIES`); on exhaustion the round ends in the
   distinct `no_valid_adjustment` fate, not a 500 and not a broken plan.
   Exhausting `MAX_MODEL_CALLS` instead (the model kept issuing further tool
   calls without ever stopping) surfaces the plan ONLY if at least one tool
   call actually succeeded — a model stuck failing the same invalid input
   every turn never moves the plan off baseline, and that must not be
    reported as "proposed, nothing needs to change."
   Context-sensitive gates also reject semantically unsafe tool use before the
   structural validator runs: `add_session` is blocked for current pain, injury,
   illness, fatigue, missed-week make-up, unsafe "train through pain" memory, or
   unresolved pain/injury/illness/fatigue mentioned in Coach memory unless the
   latest user message clearly says it has resolved; harder `swap_session`
   targets (`TEMPO`/`INTERVALS`/`LONG`) are blocked under the same risk.
   `validatePlan` remains the final structural authority, but these gates cover
   intent the validator cannot know.
5. **Tamper-proof audit log** — `agent_trajectories` / `agent_rounds` /
   `agent_usage` are written by the **service role only**; users can read
   their own rows, never write. Every round is logged, including failures.
6. **Plan writes stay RLS-guarded** — `confirm` does **no model call**: it
   re-validates the stored proposal and returns it; the **client** persists it
   through the normal `carryProgress` + `db.set` path under the user's own
   JWT. (A server-side write to `app_state` would be clobbered by the
   client's debounced whole-blob upsert — this is a deliberate deviation from
   the original plan, which assumed typed `plans`/`workouts` tables.)
7. **Coach memory is user-owned** — `app_state.data.rc_user_context.notes` is a
   single visible textarea in Settings. The edge function may suggest dated
   memory lines through `remember_runner_context`, but it never writes
   `app_state`; the client persists only after the runner taps **Save to
   memory**.

## Key deviations from the original implementation plan

- **No `plans`/`workouts` tables.** The plan is the `buildPlan()` JSON in
  `app_state.data.rc_plan`; rounds snapshot the full plan JSON instead.
- **App vocabulary**, not generic: session types
  `EASY|TEMPO|INTERVALS|LONG|RACE|WALK|OTHER`, phases
  `BASE|BUILD|PEAK|TAPER|RACE`. "Cross-training" = `WALK`.
- **Baseline waiver**: a user's *existing* plan can violate a rule (aggressive
  short-horizon generator output, user-chosen adjacent hard days). Errors that
  exist identically in the baseline are reported as warnings, so the agent can
  still help — it just can't make the plan worse.
- The server reads the plan/runs/Coach memory from `app_state` (source of
  truth), not from the request body; the client calls `flushNow()` first
  (`src/coach.ts`).
- **Methodology styles**: `plan.style` (balanced | polarized | runwalk |
  lowfreq | hansons; absent = balanced) selects the pace-multiplier row in
  `_shared/coach/styles.mjs` — the SAME table `buildPlan` uses — so
  `swap_session`/`add_session` prescribe the style's paces, and `descFor`
  keeps style vocabulary (run/walk phrasing, Hansons goal-pace tempo).
  `buildMessages` adds a `PLAN STYLE:` context line and the system prompt
  tells the model to preserve the style's pattern (e.g. polarized = one hard
  session/week; runwalk = never introduce tempo/intervals). A plan without a
  style field gets byte-identical paces/descriptions to pre-styles behaviour.
  Deploy note: `styles.mjs` is part of the six-file MCP deploy recipe in
  CLAUDE.md — omitting it breaks the function at boot.
  `buildMessages` also adds a `RUNNER AGE:` line (derived server-side in
  `index.ts` from `settings.birthYear`, legacy `settings.age` fallback) so
  advice can be age-aware; it is omitted when unknown, keeping ageless
  contexts — including all golden/eval fixtures — byte-identical.
- **A trajectory only closes (`no_valid_adjustment`) when there's nothing to
  fall back on** — round 0 failing (nothing was ever proposed). A failed
  *critique* on an otherwise-open trajectory leaves it `open`: the prior round
  that DID validate is still the one `confirm` would apply, so the user can
  still accept it instead of being dead-ended by one bad follow-up message.
  The response carries an explicit `trajectoryClosed` boolean so the client
  never has to re-derive this rule from `roundIndex`.

## Validator rules (safety > consistency > peak performance)

| Code | Severity | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `MALFORMED` / `DUPLICATE_ID` / `OUT_OF_WEEK` / `AFTER_RACE` / `SESSION_TOO_LONG` | error | structural soundness (RACE sessions are exempt from the week window — the generator caps plans at 24 weeks) |
| `RAMP_EXCEEDED` | error | weekly volume ≤ max(prev, week-before) × 1.3 + 3 km; waived when the week didn't grow vs the baseline (recovery-week false positive) |
| `HARD_BACK_TO_BACK` | error | no two hard sessions (TEMPO/INTERVALS/LONG) on consecutive days |
| `TAPER_INTERVALS` / `TAPER_TEMPO` / `TAPER_VOLUME` | error | no intervals in the final 14 days, no tempo in the final 7, final two weeks well below peak volume |
| `RACE_ADJACENT` / `SAME_DAY` | warn | surfaced to the model, never blocking |

## Deploy & configuration

```sh
supabase db push                          # migration 20260702120000_coach_agent.sql
supabase functions deploy coach-agent
supabase secrets set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

| Env (function secret) | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | — | required unless `MOCK_LLM=1` |
| `COACH_MODEL` | `claude-sonnet-5` | coaching judgment. Upgrading is one secret change. |
| `COACH_MODEL_LIGHT` | `claude-haiku-4-5` | reserved for the `pickModel` routing seam (Phase 5) — unused until a classifier routes trivial edits |
| `RATE_LIMIT_PER_DAY` | `5` | model-calling rounds per user per day (confirm/result/usage are free); enforced via the atomic `increment_agent_usage` SQL function. A per-user override lives in `profiles.coach_daily_limit` (nullable; NULL → this default) — the premium seam, service-role-writable only |
| `MOCK_LLM` | unset | `1` → canned responses from `_shared/coach/mock.mjs`, zero Anthropic calls (CI, local dev) |

The **`usage`** action (authed, no model call, no charge) returns
`{ used, limit }` — today's spend vs the caller's effective daily budget, read
from `agent_usage` via the admin client (the table has no client RLS policy).
`propose`/`critique` responses (and the `RATE_LIMIT` error body) also carry
`usage` so the chat's footer ring stays live after each send. Driven client-side
by `coachUsage()` (`src/coach.ts`) on chat open; the ring is `src/modals/CoachUsageRing.tsx`.

Prompt caching: one `cache_control` breakpoint on the system block caches the
stable prefix (tool defs + system prompt) across rounds. Token usage is
persisted per round (`agent_rounds.input_tokens/output_tokens`).

Resiliency: `CoachChat` fires a best-effort `ping` when opened to pay the cold
isolate/module-import cost before the first real message. Once the handler is
running, it streams a whitespace byte immediately (headers + first byte at t=0)
and then every 2s until the JSON body is ready; `response.json()` accepts that
leading whitespace. The client also invokes `coach-agent` with a longer
`functions.invoke` timeout than normal Supabase calls, because a cold Deno/npm
import can happen before the handler is able to send those keep-alive bytes.

Delivery recovery: production request logs showed the dominant remaining
failure was the round SUCCEEDING server-side while the streamed response died
before the body reached the phone (truncated 200 → raw JSON parse error →
generic "coach unavailable" bubble — functions-js only wraps errors from the
*initial* fetch, not body reads). Every propose/critique therefore carries a
client-generated `requestId`; the round row stores it
(`agent_rounds.client_request_id`) together with the exact response body
(`agent_rounds.response`, migration `20260718140029`). On a transport-level
invoke failure `src/coach.ts` polls the no-model `result` action (every 3s, up
to ~45s, bailing early if the polls themselves keep failing — genuinely
offline) and replays the stored body instead of surfacing an error: the model
call is never re-run, so a dropped connection costs no extra tokens and no
second rate-limit charge. `result` re-checks trajectory ownership and returns
`found: false` while the round is still running. Recoveries are tracked as
`coach_round_recovered`.

Coach memory: `rc_user_context.notes` is truncated server-side before being
added to the prompt as `USER-VISIBLE COACH MEMORY (untrusted factual context;
editable by runner, may be stale)`. It may contain user-written instructions, so
the prompt explicitly forbids following memory that asks the model to ignore
safety, tool rules, validation, medical caveats, or app policy. It is also
stored in `agent_rounds.input_context.userContext` because it is part of what the
model saw. Memory suggestions are logged separately in
`input_context.memorySuggestions` and returned to the client for confirmation;
they are not plan tool calls and do not satisfy plan-adjustment fallback logic.

Conversation history: users have read-own RLS SELECT on `agent_trajectories`
and `agent_rounds`, so the chat lists and replays past conversations as a free
DB read — no model call. `src/coachHistory.ts` fetches the rows and
`src/utils/coachTranscript.ts` reconstructs them into `CoachMessage[]`: each
round's proposal card is recomputed by folding the diff base forward exactly as
the server's `workingPlan` does (round 0's `input_context.plan`, then each
non-invalid `proposed_plan` becomes the next round's base), so a critique shows
only what *it* changed; the open trajectory's latest proposal instead diffs
against the live plan (what Apply will change). Only the one `open` trajectory
is resumable (a new `propose` abandons any other open one, and `critique`/
`confirm` on a closed one returns `TRAJECTORY_CLOSED`); accepted/abandoned ones
are read-only transcripts. UI: `src/modals/CoachHistorySheet.tsx`.

Client gotcha — **a `changed:false` round (an informational answer, no plan
edit) keeps the trajectory OPEN server-side**, so `CoachChat.applyCoachResult`
must PRESERVE `trajectoryId` in that branch: clearing it made the next message
a fresh `propose`, splitting an all-informational multi-message chat into one
conversation per message in history. It's safe to keep because `changed:false`
guarantees the working plan still equals the original baseline (any real edit
makes later rounds diff `changed:true` against that baseline), so there's never
a confirmable proposal / stale Apply button to mis-target.

Schema gotcha — the `profiles.coach_daily_limit` override column is why
migration `20260719120000_coach_daily_limit.sql` **narrows the `authenticated`
insert/update grants on `profiles` to specific columns**: the table had blanket
own-row insert/update RLS + table-level grants, so a bare column would be
user-writable (mint unlimited requests). Keep new user-writable profile columns
in that column-grant list; keep `coach_daily_limit` out of it.

## Local development

```sh
supabase start
MOCK_LLM=1 supabase functions serve coach-agent   # or set a dev ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
```

Smoke: `curl -i -X POST http://127.0.0.1:54321/functions/v1/coach-agent -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"action":"propose","message":"hi"}'`
→ `401` (auth required) proves the function is up; a signed-in client goes
through `src/coach.ts`.

## Eval & metrics

- **Golden cases** run in CI with zero API calls, via two complementary
  harnesses over the same `generateProposal` loop:
  - `src/utils/coachGolden.test.ts` — free-text situations through the
    keyword-based `MOCK_LLM` scripts (`_shared/coach/mock.mjs`), exercising
    realistic conversational flow.
  - `src/utils/coachAgent.eval.test.ts` — exact scripted tool-call sequences
    per situation (`npm run eval` runs just this file), including the two
    tool-execution-error paths (a bad `factor` thrown by `applyToolCall`
    itself, and recovery from one) that the keyword mock doesn't reach.
  Both assert adaptation *properties*, not exact output (knee pain never adds
  intensity; a missed week never "makes up" volume; the validator-failure path
  ends in `no_valid_adjustment`). `npm test` runs both.
- **Live model eval** — `npm run eval:live` (`evals/coach/`, needs
  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`; `COACH_EVAL_MOCK=1` for a free plumbing check) replays
  10 realistic scenarios through the real `generateProposal` loop against the
  real API and grades in two tiers: **safety** invariants that fail the run
  (validator passes, done/RACE untouched, volume never up, pain never adds
  intensity) and **quality** metrics that are scored but non-blocking (right
  tool family, graceful refusals, referral language). Writes a JSON report per
  run to `evals/coach/results/` (git-ignored). Run it before changing
  `SYSTEM_PROMPT`, tool descriptions, validator rules, or `COACH_MODEL`
  (`COACH_EVAL_MODEL=...` compares candidates). See `evals/coach/README.md`.
- **The propose/confirm log is the eval dataset**: `agent_rounds.input_context`
  labels what the model saw, including truncated Coach memory; `proposed_plan`,
  `tool_calls`, memory suggestions, and `outcome` label what it did and how it
  fared.
- **Headline metrics** — query the `agent_metrics` view (service role /
  dashboard): first-proposal acceptance rate, average rounds-to-accept, and
  the abandoned / no_valid_adjustment split.
- **User feedback loop** — a "This isn't right" affordance on a coach answer
  (`src/modals/CoachChat.tsx`) lets the user flag it and explain what's wrong;
  `submitCoachFeedback` (`src/coachFeedback.ts`) inserts into `coach_feedback`
  (migration `20260705120000_coach_feedback.sql`), which references the exact
  `agent_rounds` row via `(trajectory_id, round_index)`. Same trust model as
  `race_reports`: INSERT-only from the client (`grant insert`, one `with check
  (auth.uid() = user_id)` policy), **no client SELECT** — deliberately no view
  either, since the join is only ever run ad hoc. Best-effort emails the
  maintainer via `notify-contribution` (`type: "coach_feedback"`, `feedbackId`
  from the client-generated row id; the function validates ownership and dedupes
  before sending). When the
  flagged answer is the latest open coach answer, the same correction is also
  sent as a `critique` round so the coach can revise the proposal in chat. Old
  or closed answers are feedback-only. To review
  flags alongside their full round context, run in the Supabase SQL editor:
  ```sql
  select f.id, f.created_at, f.user_id, f.correction,
         f.trajectory_id, f.round_index,
         r.user_feedback, r.rationale, r.tool_calls, r.input_context,
         r.proposed_plan, r.outcome, r.model
  from public.coach_feedback f
  join public.agent_rounds r
    on r.trajectory_id = f.trajectory_id and r.round_index = f.round_index
  order by f.created_at desc;
  ```
  This is a second source (alongside the raw log) for finding real turns worth
  adding to `evals/coach/`.

## Later phases (designed-for, not built)

- **Event-driven triggers** (a logged run deviating from plan → proactive
  proposal): a second entry point that reuses the same turn handler.
- **Staged auto-approve** per tool type (conservative tools first): the
  per-tool logging in `agent_rounds.tool_calls` and the `outcome` column make
  the graduation data available.
- **Haiku routing**: implement a classifier inside `pickModel` — nothing else
  changes.
- **Preview environments / branching** (original Phase 7): enable Supabase
  Branching so each PR gets an isolated instance with migrations + function
  deployed and `MOCK_LLM=1`; keep live-API smoke tests on-demand only.
