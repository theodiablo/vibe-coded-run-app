# Live run tracking (GPS) & the native shells

The GPS pipeline, route storage, run analytics, native permission flows, and
the Android/iOS shell build gotchas. Moved out of CLAUDE.md; keep this current
when touching tracking or the shells. Background-location policy detail is in
`docs/background-location.md`.

## GPS funnel & UI

- **Single GPS funnel:** `src/hooks/useRunTracker.ts` owns all geolocation
  (`watchPosition`), the start/pause/resume/stop state machine, moving-time
  accounting, wake lock, and a `localStorage` recovery buffer (`LIVE_RUN_KEY`,
  deliberately NOT synced to the app_state blob). Keep GPS access behind this
  hook so the source can swap without touching the UI.
- **UI:** `src/modals/LiveRunTracker.tsx` (full-screen, gated by `showTracker`
  in `RunningCoach`, opened via `shared.openTracker`). On finish it funnels
  into the normal save path — `goLog(prefill)` → `LogView` → `addRuns` —
  passing measured `durationSec`/`elevation` and the trace ref.

## Route storage (`run_routes`)

**Traces are NOT in the blob.** The polyline lives in its own Supabase
`run_routes` table via `src/routes.ts` (direct queries, not `db`); a run only
stores a `routeId` reference. `deleteRun` cascades to `deleteRoute`;
backup/restore include routes. Offline saves queue in `localStorage` and relink
on next load via `flushPendingRoutes` (run carries a temp
`routeTmp`/`routePending`).

The `run_routes.stats` JSONB is a free-form sidecar: besides the summary
`{km,durationSec,elevation,avgPace}`, a run also stores its **raw ~1Hz HR
stream** there as `stats.hrSamples: {bpm,t}[]` (kept raw, NOT projected onto
GPS points, so HR fidelity is decoupled from `simplify()`'s point thinning).
Sources: a BLE-strap run (`LiveRunTracker.handleSave` from `rt.hrSamples`), a
HealthKit import (Apple Watch route + HR series), a Health Connect import (HR
series, no route), and file imports (GPX/TCX/FIT HR). All imports funnel
through `persistImportedRoute` (`src/imports/persistRoutes.ts`), which folds
`ImportedRun.hrSamples` into the sidecar; the two pure cleaners for raw native
payloads are `normalizeRoutePoints`/`normalizeHrSamples`
(`src/imports/series.ts`).

**A run with GPS points rides `routeId`; an HR-only sidecar (HR but no route —
the common Health Connect case) rides a SEPARATE `hrRouteId`** so History's map
button (gated on `routeId`) never offers a blank map, while `RunDetailModal`
still fetches it (`useRouteTrace` resolves `routeId ?? hrRouteId`) to draw the
HR chart + time-in-zone card (that card is NOT gated on GPS). `deleteRun`
cascades both; `LogView` prefill carries `hrRouteId`. Unknown JSONB key →
forward/backward safe, and backup/restore/pending-queue carry it free. To store
more per-run series later, extend this sidecar rather than widening the
4-tuple.

Because that stream can be hundreds of KB on a long run,
`getRoute(id, withStats)` / `useRouteTrace(run, {withStats})` gate the `stats`
fetch: map-only surfaces (History's route preview) pass `false`, only
`RunDetailModal` passes `true`. Keep new map-only consumers on
`withStats:false`.

## Per-run analytics (`src/modals/RunDetailModal.tsx`)

Tap a run in History or the Dashboard recent-runs list (`RunRow` has an
optional `onClick`; hub seam `shared.openRunDetail`, guarded on arg shape) →
full-screen map + a combined elevation/pace/HR `ComposedChart` (toggleable
series) + per-km split table + HR time-in-zone card + stat tiles. All
chart/table data is derived at render by **pure, tested helpers**:
`buildRunSeries` (`src/utils/runSeries.ts`, cumulative distance + smoothed pace
+ timestamp-aligned HR), `buildSplits` (`src/utils/runSplits.ts`), and
`timeInZones` (`src/utils/hr.ts`, reuses `runZoneIndex`/`HR_ZONES`). Both
series helpers share ONE gap-aware cumulative-distance walk, `flattenTrack`
(`src/utils/geo.ts`) — don't re-roll a third.

**Pace smoothing uses a rolling ~200m DISTANCE window, not a time window:**
stored points are Douglas-Peucker-thinned so they're sparse/uneven in time, and
a fixed time window left pace null (an intermittent line) on straight sparsely
sampled stretches. The trace is fetched via the shared `useRouteTrace` hook
(`src/hooks/`); the derived chart/table/zone data is `useMemo`'d on the trace
(the modal re-renders on unrelated hub state + every toggle click).

**Chart gotchas:** the distance x-axis MUST be `type="number"`
(post-`simplify` points are unevenly km-spaced; a categorical axis misplaces
them), and every series needs its own `yAxisId` matching a `<YAxis>` (recharts
errors otherwise) — both guarded by the render test in
`RunDetailModal.test.tsx`. HR series/cards render only when `stats.hrSamples`
is present (degrade gracefully otherwise).

**Chart↔map link:** the map passes `endpoints` (distinct start/finish markers,
replacing the live head dot) and a `highlight` point; hovering/tapping the
chart sets a `cursor` (a single nullable **index**, derived-during-render +
clamped to the trace), and `RunChart` (`memo`'d, with a stable `onCursor`)
reports recharts' `activeTooltipIndex`. **Gotcha:** recharts v3 hands that
index back as a STRING (`String(clampedIndex)`) for Line/Area/Composed charts,
so coerce it through `activeIndexFromChartState` (a `typeof === "number"` check
is always false → a permanently-null cursor). This works ONLY because
`buildRunSeries` and `flattenTrack` emit one row per real point in the same
order, so `series[i]` and `flat[i]` are the same point — an invariant locked by
a test in `RunDetailModal.test.tsx`. Use the index, never `activeLabel`
(float-matching the numeric axis). The exported `Readout` shows the highlighted
point's stats with a fixed min-height (no layout shift); `onPick` maps a map
tap back to the nearest `flat` point.

## Geo math

`src/utils/geo.ts` (haversine, jitter-gated `distanceKm`, hysteresis
`elevGainM`, Douglas–Peucker `simplify`, `segments`). A point is the tuple
`[lat, lng, tEpochMs, alt|null]`; a `null` entry is a GAP marker (don't bridge
it). Map basemap is MapTiler — needs `VITE_MAPTILER_KEY` (records fine without
it, just no tiles). The style is a custom map (`MAP_STYLE_ID` in
`src/constants.ts`) forked from `outdoor-v4` and decluttered for running;
edited at cloud.maptiler.com and shared by every map surface via that one
constant.

## `RouteMap` — the ONE shared map

`RouteMap` (`src/components/RouteMap.tsx`) is the one shared map component
(imperative Leaflet via refs, no react-leaflet, all markers inline SVG/CSS
divIcons — no PNG, CSP/native-WebView-safe). Additive props default inert so
History/LocationPicker are untouched: `endpoints`/`highlight`/`onPick` drive
the run-detail chart link (above). **Live nav-follow:** `follow` auto-centres
the head, but a user pan/zoom suspends it (`dragstart`/`zoomstart`, guarded
against our own `programmaticSetView` via a ref so a synchronous
`setView({animate:false})` isn't read as a gesture), reported via
`onFollowingChange`; bumping `recenterSignal` snaps back to the head at
`LIVE_DEFAULT_ZOOM` and re-arms follow. `LiveRunTracker` keeps the live map
`interactive`, shows a recenter FAB while `!following`, and bumps
`recenterSignal` on `visibilitychange`→visible (screen unlock / app
foreground) — the requested zoom reset on return from a locked screen. New
primitive-keyed effects (`[highlight?.lat, highlight?.lng]`,
`[recenterSignal]`) sit AFTER the track effect so they layer on top and never
fight the polyline redraw.

## Native background tracking (the `geoSource` seam)

Browser tracking is foreground-only (screen must stay on). True background
recording runs in the **Capacitor shells** (Android + iOS) that swap the GPS
source behind `useRunTracker`'s interface. The hook never touches
`navigator.geolocation` directly — it goes through `geoSource`
(`src/geo/source.ts`), which picks `webSource` (`src/geo/web.ts`,
`navigator.geolocation`, unchanged web behaviour) or `nativeSource`
(`src/geo/native.ts`: @capacitor-community/background-geolocation — Android
foreground service / iOS background location mode — for `background:true`,
@capacitor/geolocation for the idle preview). Selection is by `isNative`
(`src/native.ts` → `Capacitor.isNativePlatform()`), which also sets
`window.__NATIVE_SHELL__` for the UI; `platform`/`isAndroid`/`isIos` (same
module) gate platform-exclusive integrations (Health Connect vs HealthKit) — a
synced preference naming the other platform's integration must degrade to
"off" locally, never render its UI.

**One bundle serves all** web + shells; `isNative` is false in any browser, so
the web build is unchanged — keep it that way. To add a GPS source, implement
the `isAvailable / watchPosition(onPos,onErr,{background}) / clearWatch`
interface and hand `onPos` a
`{coords:{latitude,longitude,altitude,accuracy}, timestamp}` object (see
`adaptBgLocation`). Native auth uses a deep link (`AUTH_DEEP_LINK` in
`src/supabase.ts`, completed in `App.tsx`; Android intent filter +
`CFBundleURLTypes` in `ios/App/App/Info.plist`). Build: `npx cap sync
android|ios` then `.github/workflows/release.yml` (one `v*` tag ships both
stores); the web S3/CloudFront deploy stays untouched.

## iOS shell (`ios/`)

Capacitor 8 generated an **SPM** project (no CocoaPods) — `cap sync ios`
rewrites `ios/App/CapApp-SPM/Package.swift` and correctly excludes the
Android-only pianissimo Health Connect plugin (no `Package.swift`/ios dir). It
runs fine on Linux; only `xcodebuild` needs a Mac. Commit the Xcode workspace
`Package.resolved`. SwiftPM can retain an old background-geolocation manifest
by package identity after an npm upgrade; if it reports a Capacitor 7/8
constraint conflict, reset package caches or resolve with fresh DerivedData
rather than replacing Capacitor's generated package path.

App-local Swift plugins are NOT auto-registered: `MainViewController.swift`
(the storyboard's custom class) registers `HealthKitBridgePlugin` in
`capacitorDidLoad()`. New Swift files must be hand-added to `project.pbxproj`
(build-file + file-ref + group + sources phase); `ios-pr.yml` (no-signing
Simulator build on PRs touching `ios/**`) is the compile check. Info.plist owns
the permission strings, `UIBackgroundModes` (`location`, `bluetooth-central`),
the deep-link scheme, and `ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption=false`;
`App.entitlements` carries the HealthKit capability.

## Android permission gotchas

- **The permission prompt silently no-ops when Location Services are off:**
  `@capacitor/geolocation`'s `checkPermissions()`/`requestPermissions()` are
  gated *by the plugin itself* on the device's system Location toggle — they
  **reject immediately if it's off, before ever showing the OS permission
  dialog**. `getCurrentPosition()`/`watchPosition()` aren't gated that way:
  they request the runtime permission themselves, then (via Google Play
  Services) surface the system "turn on device location" dialog if needed.
  `ensureForegroundPermission` (`src/geo/native.ts`) uses `checkPermissions()`
  only as a fast-path "already granted" check and falls back to a real
  `getCurrentPosition()` probe — the one call that can actually show both
  dialogs — whenever that check doesn't succeed.
- **Precise vs approximate location hinges on `enableHighAccuracy`.** On
  Android 12+ the plugin picks the runtime permission from
  `enableHighAccuracy`: `false` requests the COARSE-only alias, so the OS
  dialog never shows the "Precise" toggle and the user can only grant
  *Approximate*. Run tracking needs FINE GPS, so
  `ensureForegroundPermission(highAccuracy)` defaults to `true` and the
  run-tracking call sites pass `true`; only Discover's "races near me" one-off
  passes `false` (approximate is enough — don't over-ask). The fast-path
  "already granted" check is accuracy-aware (`isFineGranted` for a precise ask,
  `isGranted` for coarse) so a user who previously granted only Approximate is
  routed back through the probe to re-offer precise. A resolved probe still
  returns `true` even if the user picks Approximate — choosing it degrades
  accuracy, it never blocks the run.
- **Background location (`ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION`) ships to all users.**
  Screen-off recording via the foreground service alone left minutes-long GPS
  holes on some devices once the WebView froze, so the permission is declared
  in the **main** manifest and requested for everyone. The Play declaration is
  **already approved** and `public/privacy.html` covers it — but read
  `docs/background-location.md` before touching this: materially changing the
  location use case would need a fresh Play re-declaration. Request flow (all
  Android): the prominent `BgLocationDisclosure` (a Play requirement, shown
  before the OS prompt, dismissable via "Not now") →
  `nativeSource.requestPermissions` runs `ensureForegroundPermission(true)`
  FIRST, then `ensureBackgroundLocationOnce()` (`src/geo/background.ts`,
  Android-only, once per install via `BG_LOC_ASKED_KEY`) → then
  `POST_NOTIFICATIONS`. On Android 11+ the background grant is a **Settings
  round-trip** ("Allow all the time") that cannot appear in the first dialog —
  so the disclosure shows an explicit bolded 3-step walkthrough
  (`login.bgLocation.step1/2/3`), gated on `isBackgroundLocationAvailable()`.
  A declined background grant **never blocks the run**.
  `RunPermissionsPlugin.kt`'s background-location methods keep the
  `isBackgroundLocationDeclared()` guard as defensive code.
- **`POST_NOTIFICATIONS` (Android 13+) is requested by the local
  `RunPermissions` plugin** (`android/.../RunPermissionsPlugin.kt`, registered
  in `MainActivity.java`), because neither geolocation plugin requests it and
  without it the foreground service's ongoing "recording run" notification is
  silently suppressed (the service still runs — recording is never blocked).
  The JS seam is `src/geo/notifications.ts`:
  `requestRunNotificationsOnce()` asks once per install (`REC_NOTIF_ASKED_KEY`)
  the first time a run starts — wired into `LiveRunTracker`'s `guardedStart` +
  `acceptDisclosure`, before the service starts. Below Android 13 it's a no-op.
- **Every native Start/Resume is gated on a live location check**
  (`guardedStart` in `LiveRunTracker`): after the disclosure, it `await`s
  `rt.requestPermissions()` (→ `ensureForegroundPermission`) and aborts if it
  returns false, so a run never enters the "tracking" state with a running
  clock and a blank map. That one call covers BOTH failure causes — permission
  not granted (OS prompt) and Location Services off (the `getCurrentPosition`
  probe surfaces the "turn on location" dialog) — and on denial sets
  `tracker.errors.permissionDeniedNative`. For a granted user with location on
  it fast-paths (a bare `checkPermissions()`, no dialog), so it's not a per-run
  nag. Don't drop this gate back to "start and hope" — the silent blank-map run
  was the bug.

## GPS tracking diagnostics (dev-only, native)

A hidden per-device ring buffer (`src/geo/trackLog.ts`, `GEO_DIAG_LOG_KEY`,
**never synced**, capped at `GEO_DIAG_LOG_MAX`) records the live tracker's
event stream — each raw `native-fix` arrival at the JS boundary, whether it was
kept (`fix`) or dropped (`drop`, with reason) or opened a `gap`, plus
permission/watch/foreground-background transitions. Instrumented in
`useRunTracker.ts` and `geo/native.ts`. Logging is a **no-op until enabled**
(`isGeoDebugEnabled`, cached in-module so the per-fix cost is nil when off).
Viewer is `src/views/TrackDiagLog.tsx` — revealed by the SAME Settings →
Connections title 5-tap as the watch sync log (`revealTap` flips `setGeoDebug`
too); its summary reports max fix-gap **while hidden vs visible**, the direct
read on "do fixes stop when the screen is off". Raw + English-only (a debug
surface, not wired through i18n), mirroring `WatchSyncLog`.

## npm dependency patches (`patches/`)

Applied by `postinstall` → `patch-package`; native plugin modules compile
straight out of `node_modules` (`android/capacitor.settings.gradle`), so a
committed patch reaches every local and CI build. Current patch:
`@capacitor-community/background-geolocation` crashed in production ("Unable to
pause activity" → NPE at `Bridge.getPermissionStates`, Bridge.java:1217)
because its `handleOnPause`/`handleOnResume` call
`getPermissionState("location")` — the annotation-reflection path — on every
activity pause/resume; the patch computes the same both-granted COARSE+FINE
check via `ActivityCompat.checkSelfPermission` in a try/catch instead. The
dependency is **pinned exact** (no `^`) so the patch always matches; on a
version bump, check whether upstream fixed the lifecycle permission check (repo
issue tracker was silent as of 1.2.26 and the plugin lags on Capacitor majors —
see its issue #156), then regenerate
(`npx patch-package @capacitor-community/background-geolocation`) or delete the
patch.

## Android release builds & R8

`android/app/build.gradle` keeps `minifyEnabled true`, `shrinkResources true`,
and the optimized default ProGuard file for `release`. Capacitor's consumer
rules preserve annotated plugin entrypoints (the classes), but **not the
`com.getcapacitor` annotation classes themselves** — and AGP 8's default R8
*full mode* strips runtime annotation data unless the annotation class is kept,
which broke Capacitor's reflection-based permission machinery in production
(NPE at `Bridge.getPermissionStates`, hit both by background-geolocation's
lifecycle hooks — the `patches/` workaround — and by
`Geolocation.checkPermissions()`/`watchPosition()` when the live tracker
opens). Fix is two-layer: `android/app/proguard-rules.pro` keeps the Capacitor
annotation classes + runtime-annotation attributes, and
`android/gradle.properties` sets `android.enableR8.fullMode=false` as a safety
net (removable only after the full tracker flow is verified on-device on a
full-mode build). Add further narrow library-specific keep rules only when a
release build or on-device test demonstrates a reflection requirement (checked:
the ION geolocation AAR that @capacitor/geolocation 7+ wraps ships no consumer
rules but does no reflection). Debug builds stay unminified; `android-pr.yml`
also runs `bundleRelease` so PR CI compiles R8 — but a green build does NOT
prove runtime correctness: R8 stripping a reflectively-used class/method still
builds successfully and only crashes on-device, so validate release behaviour
on a device before shipping. Because the release AAB is obfuscated,
`release.yml` uploads the per-build R8 `mapping.txt` (artifact
`running-coach-mapping-<code>`) — it's the only way to deobfuscate native crash
stacks (PostHog `captureError`) and is regenerated each build, so never rely on
it surviving elsewhere.
