// The Live Activity's data contract, compiled into BOTH the app target (which
// starts/updates the activity via LiveActivityPlugin) and the widget extension
// (which renders it) — the two must agree byte-for-byte for ActivityKit to
// decode the content state, which is why this is one shared file, not two
// copies.
//
// Same architecture as the Android lock-screen notification (see
// src/utils/runNotification.ts): the ticking duration is OS-rendered — the
// widget shows `Text(_, style: .timer)` off `startedAtMs` — so the clock keeps
// counting while the WebView's JS is throttled or suspended in the background;
// the JS seam only pushes `message` when the data (distance/pace/HR) changes.
