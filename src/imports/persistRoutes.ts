// LiveRunTracker.handleSave. Runs with neither pass through untouched. This is
// THE step the ImportProvider contract assigns to the caller: providers return
// points/hrSamples, the save path persists them into the (blob-external)
// run_routes row, and neither reaches addRuns.
//
// A GPS trace rides `routeId` (History shows a map button). An HR-only sidecar
// (HR series, no GPS — the common Garmin/Samsung-on-Health-Connect case) rides
// the separate `hrRouteId`, so the run powers the detail HR chart/time-in-zone
// card without History offering a blank map. The raw HR stream sits in the same
// `stats.hrSamples` sidecar a BLE-strap run uses.

    //   need a parallel queue that relinks `hrRouteId` — real complexity for
    //   enrichment-only data (the HR is still summarised on the run). GPS traces
    //   ARE user-authored data worth that machinery; a derived series isn't.
