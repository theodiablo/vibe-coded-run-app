// The permission is declared in the main manifest and shipped to all users (which
// requires the Google Play background-location declaration — see

// native side reports declared:false and this becomes a no-op on any build/platform
// that does not declare it, so the app degrades to foreground-only rather than
// crashing. Backed by the local RunPermissions plugin (the same one that owns
// POST_NOTIFICATIONS). Android-only, never throws, never blocks recording.
