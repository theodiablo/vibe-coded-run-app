// A LIFO stack of "dismiss" handlers for the app's overlays (modals, sheets,
// the live-run sub-overlays). Each open overlay registers its dismiss via
// useDismissable; the single global dispatcher in RunningCoach (Escape on web,
// the Android hardware back button on native) closes the topmost one.
//
// A registry is used rather than routing through RunningCoach's modal booleans
// because roughly half the overlays hold their open-state in local child state
// (LocationPicker, EditRunModal, the tracker's disclosure/HR-nudge/countdown,
// InfoButton) that RunningCoach can't see. Registration order is the stack
// order, so a sub-overlay opened on top of a modal is dismissed first.
